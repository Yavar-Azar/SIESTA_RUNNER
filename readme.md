# Siesta Runner

SIESTA Runner

SIESTA Runner is a Python package developed as part of the SIESTA CLOUD project to automate the configuration, execution, and post-processing of SIESTA calculations. Built upon the ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment) library, it facilitates running and analyzing simulations both on local machines and remote clusters. This package also formats results for visualization in JavaScript-based web applications, making it highly adaptable for integration into web platforms.

----------------------------
## Key Features:

- Automated Configuration and Execution: Simplifies running SIESTA simulations by managing configurations, atomistic setup, and calculator parameters.
- Post-Processing Capabilities: Provides robust analysis and post-processing routines, including energy calculations, density of states (DOS), charge distribution, and more.
- Visualization-Friendly Outputs: Formats analysis results as JSON files optimized for JavaScript frontends, enabling interactive visualization in web applications.
- Standalone Usability: Can be used on clusters or local machines independently of the SIESTA CLOUD platform.
- Extendable Analysis Module: Supports single-point, molecular dynamics (MD), and relaxation simulations with modular analysis tools.
